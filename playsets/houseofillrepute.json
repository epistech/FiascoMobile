		"Setting in Brief",
        "House of Ill Repute focuses on the political hotbed that is Westminster, the seat of the UK Government. Incompetent and venal politicians scrabble for power and influence while corrupt officials line their pockets and out-of- control journalists hack into phones and email accounts. Of course, there are noble politicians, pure-hearted bureaucrats and admirable journalists – but they probably aren't the focus in a Fiasco game. Then again, it's always interesting to see what an idealist will do to achieve their aims when surrounded by ruthless bastards and bumbling idiots.",
		"UK Politics for Beginners",
		"A primer on how UK politics works may be helpful:",
		"* The head of state is the Queen but her role is entirely ceremonial. In theory she is vested with the power to declare war, appoint the prime minister and veto legislation, but if she did a constitutional crisis would likely follow.",
		"* The real power is held by the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, who is the Prime Minister, the head of the Government. He or she appoints Ministers (nearly always Members of Parliament), who make decisions about how the country should be run. The group of the most important Ministers is called the Cabinet.",
		"* The Government has an army of staff. Most are civil servants, who are supposed to be politically neutral and serve whichever Government is elected, but in Fiasco may not be. Some are special advisers, aka spin doctors, who are political appointees and anything but neutral.",
		"* The House of Commons is one of the two chambers of Parliament, consisting of elected MPs (Members of Parliament). It has the power to vote on legislation but usually just does what the Government wants.",
		"* The House of Lords is the second chamber of Parliament, consisting of appointed peers with titles like Lord Snebworth of Fauntleroy. It can and does block Government legislation.",
		"* Non-Ministerial MPs and peers are termed \"back benchers.\"",
		"* Back benchers are kept in line by the Government's Whips through persuasion, arm-twisting and if necessary blackmail.",
		"* The second largest party in the House of Commons is called the Opposition, and runs it's own \"shadow\" Cabinet. When the Government is doing badly, the Opposition is seen as the Government-in-waiting. When the Government is on top, the Opposition is irrelevant and desperate for attention.",
		"* Don't forget the great British press! Highbrow broadsheets like The Times jostle with tabloid \"red tops\" like The Sun.",
		"The Place To Be",
		"There are a number of locations which are unavoidable in a game about Westminster politics:",
		"* The Palace of Westminster, AKA Parliament, the home of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.",
		"* Whitehall, where Government Ministers have their offices staffed by legions of bureaucrats. Home to the mighty Treasury and the august Foreign and Commonwealth Office.",
		"* Number 10 Downing Street, in the centre of Whitehall, where the Prime Minister lives and works, and where Cabinet meetings are held.",
		"* Fleet Street, home of the great British press.",
		"Events, Dear Boy, Events",
		"Politics is driven by events, so House of Ill Repute uses a table of events in place of the locations used in most Fiasco playsets. The above locations will no doubt prove useful, alongside the plethora of seedy pubs, upmarket restaurants, Westminster parks and apartments, riverside walks and so on."
