Even in Brasilia - a perfect place for ******************** shady deals and schemes - with the well known proportion of 300 crooks for each 2,5 thousand inhabitants, things can go very wrong ********************.",

Therefore, don't forget, at the Aftermath, to choose a name for that operation so that we can file it properly ********************."
