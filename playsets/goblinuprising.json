        "My king, the goblins of the eastern kingdoms threaten us all. Our scouts have heard rumours of raids on the Halfling homesteads and assaults on the elven settlements in the Morkwood. Strange noises have been heard within their putrid warrens and our wizards have sensed a surge of dark energies.",
		"As you know, the goblins are small in body but great in ambition. They have a devious cunning and an innate skill for destruction. They breed in large numbers, cast primitive sorceries, and consort with all sorts of monsters. Most dangerous of all, they have blatant disregard for their own petty lives.",
		"Our only hope is that they are too busy fighting each other, sire.",
		"Tips and Dirty Tricks",
		"This playset focuses on playing petty, vicious goblins in the style of a classic fantasy setting with dungeons and/or dragons involved. Bonus points for speaking in goblin voices, or after playing the Dragonslayers playset.",
		"If you have multiple conflicting relationships, consider having each player controlling multiple distinct goblins. You will need some spares."
