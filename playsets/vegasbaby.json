        "It always sounds like a good idea. A few days in Vegas to blow off steam before the wedding, or to celebrate closing the deal, or just for the hell of it. Just a couple days and nights of debauchery and loosened inhibitions clears the cobwebs and makes you feel alive again. Check responsibility at the door, you’re in Sin City, baby!",
        "But so are the grifters and the hookers, looking to fleece tourists. The mobsters looking for prey. Showbiz lowlifes and corrupt officials, all looking for a better deal. Desperate locals with an eye out for a quick score.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of tourists a day, from all over the world, rub elbows with the locals. Sometimes it’s champagne and caviar. Most times, it’s not. And, sometimes, it’s about burying the bodies in the desert.",
        "NOTES",
        "Vegas, Baby! assumes the Las Vegas of around 2011. This matters because, more than most cities, the \"feel\" of Las Vegas shifts considerably over time. Bugsy, Casino, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Vega$ and Ocean’s Eleven may all have been set in Las Vegas, but each period has a distinctly different vibe than modern Las Vegas. This playset will support some of these periods better than others, and the group should decide ahead of time when the game is set, and what that choice means to everyone.",
        "As for the modern Las Vegas, there are a few things to keep in mind that might diverge from the Vegas you remember:",
        "* In the 1990’s, attempts were made to turn Las Vegas into a \"family friendly\" destination. These efforts largely failed, though remnants of them linger. Since then, the pendulum has swung hard the other way, a sort of overcompensating backlash leading to lurid billboards all over the place embracing the notion of \"sin city\" in ever more explicit ways.",
        "* In 2011, Las Vegas is just starting to come out of a decade long boom/bust real-estate cycle, both residential and commercial. What this means for a game like Fiasco is financial desperation on all scales and half-constructed homes and high rises.",
        "* Most things you might feel some nostalgia for about Las Vegas no longer actually exist there, but several different overly-corporatised simulacra can be had if the price is right.",
        "* Many large hotels have now embraced the recent trend of hipster pool parties, providing \"exclusive\" pool clubs, with \"exclusive\" cover charges (double to triple cost for men), loud music and lots of booze."
