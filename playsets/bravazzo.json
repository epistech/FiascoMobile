        "Bravazzo! is set in the Italian city-state of Ferrara in 1435 at the dawning of the Renaissance.",
		"It fuses together the vain ambitions of the nobility, the desperate brutality of the peasantry, the venal profiteering of the merchants, and the mystical corruption of the priesthood in a con-fuse-ion of double-dealing, back-stabbing, empire- building, and courtly intrigue at a time when the Reason of Man was slowly emerging from the darkness of the Middle Ages.",
		"Players will assume the roles of corrupt bishops, murderous nobility, ambitious bankers, pious priests, desperate brigands, virginal maidens, and coarse peasants, in a sordid medieval fiasco."
