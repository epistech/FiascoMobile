		"Maybe decent isn't the right word.",
		"Tonight is Christmas Eve, and the sky is as full of planes as Union Station is full of trains during rush hour. The snowstorm is getting worse, grounding all flights until the morning and unceremoniously stranding several hundred people.",
		"And then there's that whole \"end of the world\" thing that's supposed to happen any time now. I don't know about any worldwide cataclysm, but all that anger and confusion should make it easy to pull a fast one.",
		"It'll be the last Christmas for at least one sap here. What a shit place to die in."
