It's a lovely little place, with helpful staff, immaculate conditions and the company of many old souls like yourself who've experienced a wealth of years.",

Something stirs inside you, the passion for one last scheme to take the edge off the monotony of day to day life in the retirement home. And maybe, just maybe, you can get out of here once and for all.",
