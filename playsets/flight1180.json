        "The titular flight in this playset is meant to hold the story together, but it probably shouldn't be the whole story. While every player's character should be on 1180, to maximize the mayhem, note how coincidental that might make things—the frequent flyer is also a smuggler and his ex is on the flight with him? This is good. This is a messed-up  flight. Embrace the cockamamie circumstances that put all these people on the same flight. Flights are bottlenecks.",
        "Play out flashbacks, if you want, to LA or the Pacific islands or office towers that lead up to the flight. Play out flashbacks set during the week, the month, the decade before the flight. The first Act is a great time for this. Here's an unofficial rule to observe: to play a flashback scene, first describe what you're character's physically doing on the plane—fiddling with a watch, bugging his seat-mate, pretending to read, etc. Use dialogue if you want. It helps set up context and contrast for your flashback scene.",
        "Be careful with flashforwards, here. If you jump ahead to after the flight, you let some of the tension out. Think about this: how are the people who get off the plane different from when they got on?",
        "People are usually pretty boring on planes but this game's called Fiasco, so try this: make at least one Tilt element take place on the plane. That way some of Act Two's juices spill over to the flight itself."
