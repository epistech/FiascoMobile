Thought to be the precocious nonsense of children, they now suffer episodes of violence and terrifying abuse at the hands of unseen forces. Their forbidden games have brought this onslaught, and they have learned them at the hands of their very neighbors and servants..",
        "Inevitable accusations have now followed. As young as five to as old as eighty, no resident of Salem Village or the surrounding townships, good Christians or no, old or young, are safe from the witch hunt..",
