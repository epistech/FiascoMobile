You’re living the southern Califonia dream. Your days are spent shopping on Rodeo Drive and your nights revolve around dining with your girlfriends at the trendy hot spot du jour.",
		"Either that, or you clean up the mess those people leave behind.",
		"Regardless, the glamorous life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. The mansion’s almost in foreclosure, your financial advisors are running a Ponzi scheme, and the your philandering husband is banging the nanny. You can’t lose it all now. If only there was some way to make all your problems disappear... forever."
