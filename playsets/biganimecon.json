        "This is a playset for games of Fiasco taking place at an anime convention in a major city in the U.S. It really helps to know anime and anime fandom if you want to use it, since some of the references just aren’t disturbing enough otherwise. I can’t say I’ve ever experienced anything worthy of a Coen Brothers movie at an anime convention, but a lot of the stuff in the tables comes from things I’ve witnessed, heard about, or at least could very easily imagine happening at an anime con. And if there was ever a group of people with \"powerful ambition and poor impulse control,\" it’s anime fans."
