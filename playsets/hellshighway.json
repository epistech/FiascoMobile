        "The year is 2074, twenty six years after a world-wide radiation accident scorched the Earth. Weaponized cars roam the Wastelands in search of gasoline, fortune and food. The slave trade is booming, corrupt officials and outlaw gangs reign free and a dwindling Highway Patrol struggles to uphold what little peace is left in the world. Brave (or stupid) Highwaymen try their luck in The League, a vicious death race in the corrupt city of Broken Hill.",
        "All is not lost however. There is a Resistance forming. A lose network of renegades, gadgeteers and freedom fighters is starting to surface. Safe houses and outposts are slowly popping up and there are even rumors of usable soil out there.",
        "Will you join an outlaw gang of marauders in search of potential slaves? Will you trick-out your car and win your fortune racing in The League? Will you seek justice and avenge the murder of your partner from the Highway Patrol? Or are you just trying to locate a pilot light to fix the passenger-side flame-thrower on the Plymouth Firebomber you stole last week?"
