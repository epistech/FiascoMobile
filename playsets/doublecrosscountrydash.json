		"You're going to be rich. Seriously rich. Miles away there's a small fortune waiting for you, if you can get there in time. Of course it's not just you. You've got your souped up engine. You've got your driving buddy. And you've got several car loads of competitors with exactly the same plan as you.",
		"It'll take determination, it'll take talent, it'll take speed and it may take a few broken rules, broken speed limited and broken rivals to get there first. But we all know nice guys finish last. What would you rather be? Nice or rich beyond your wildest dreams?",
		"Exactly!",
		"Based on films such as It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Cannonball Run and Rat Race (or even the Lovebug films), this playset represents teams racing each other to be the first to get to a dying man’s hidden stash, a dead man’s inheritance or a millionaire’s prize money, by any means possible.",
        "Optional rule for large groups: The 'Buddy' System",
		"The Buddy System is a mechanic designed to deal with larger game groups, particularly where the scenario can accommodate competing teams. It should ensure that two players connected by a Relationship don't have their turns in quick succession and then have to wait for their scene to come around again. It should also speed things up a little, by allowing Teams to work through scenes together.",
		"During the set-up of the game players may pair off with a player seated next to them as Team mates, or 'Buddies', with an internal Relationship between each other and an external Relationship to two rival Teams. If you have an uneven number of players the odd player may go it alone. Alternatively they can be the third and final member of a Team, a newcomer who doesn't share the Buddy/ Buddy relationship of the core two (and as such should be one of the players at the edge of the Team).",
		"How does the mechanic work? The Buddies effectively play as one player, with one Buddy establishing or resolving the scene on the first round in each Act, and the other doing the same second time around. Since they are a team it is likely they will both have starring roles, to some degree. Two dice (of the same colour) are awarded at the end of a Buddy scene.",
		"In Act 1 they may give these dice to each other, or may give one or both dice to a different player (Team dynamics may dictate you should give each die to a different member of a rival Team).",
		"In Act 2 they keep each die they are given. They're in this til the bitter end now.",
		"As a twist during the Tilt, particularly if the Tilt suggests so, you can re-evaluate the Team you're in, and change Buddies (as loyalties change) - move chairs so you're sitting with your new Team mate(s). Just be sure to note the Relationships you have with characters who are no longer seated next to you."
