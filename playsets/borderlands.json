        "Just on the edge of the human kingdom lies a valley whose cliff faces are riddled with caves. In these caves dwell a surprising variety of monstrous races: sneaky goblins, downtrodden kobolds, savage orcs, enormous ogres and stranger things still. These monstrous peoples are only tenuously united by the common worship of the bloody god Zemox.",
        "The human Baron of Restwell Keep is supposed to keep the monsters under control, but there isn't much he can do. Sure, every year or two you get a couple of self proclaimed \"heroes\" coming in to wipe out the monsters. But most of these adventuresome kids wind up on the wrong end of a glaive-guisarme. The monsters, they stick around. The biggest threat to the monsters isn't the human warriors, but the constant infighting between monstrous tribes. Gathering together this many violent subhumans in one place is a surefire recipe for disaster. The valley is a fiasco, just waiting to happen."
