        "There's been a murder. A body lies dead in a run-down apartment. There are signs of a struggle. Broken furniture litters the floor. Two of the victim's fingers have been cut off. There's a human turd on the mantelpiece. Hang on, what?",
        "Welcome to the world of Tartan Noir: fiction with a hardboiled, cynical, violent and frequently alcoholic view of crime in modern-day Scotland. There are good guys, there are bad guys, but there definitely aren't any heroes. Tartan Noir is about world-weary anti-heroes, deeply flawed characters with a variety of vices that would not normally be becoming of someone of their narrative stature.",
        "And while it is certainly hardboiled, there's frequently an edge of wackiness that separates Tartan Noir from its American cousin. Retired detectives running around oil rigs in their pyjamas. Christian extremists trapped in an art gallery full of pornography. And of course the aforementioned jobby on the mantelpiece. It's grim, it's grisly, but it's a hell of a lot of fun. So pour yourself a dram of single malt and prepare to indulge in a little Tartan Noir."

The movies Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, and Young Adam will also help to develop your cynical, binge drinking, Scottish streak. Finally, no Tartan Noir is complete without some miserable bastards and creative Scottish swearing. For that there is nothing better than the omnishambles of characters that make up The Thick of It." }

Any of Rankin's Inspector Rebus series and Brookmyre's Where the Bodies are Buried and When the Devil Drives would be excellent fuel for your hardboiled, whisky-drinking anti-hero. For a touch of whimsical craziness, Brookmyre's Jack Parlabane or Angelique de Xavia novels will provide excellent inspiration." }
