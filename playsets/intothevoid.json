        "In the golden age of cinema and television, when people would look up to the stars, they would see grand adventures between good and evil, with intrepid space explorers venturing out into the unknown, making the Galaxy a better place for one and all.",
		"Of course, we know better. People will be just as rotten in space as they are planetside, bringing their pettiness, bickering, backstabbing, and greed to the stars. Sure, they may talk about grand plans and bettering humanity, but its only a matter of time before someone starts to claim planets and asteroids for their own, leading to the next great gold rush.",
		"For the sake of this playset, we're assuming that we haven't gotten too far outside of our system. This isn't Star Trek or Star Wars where warp drives and hyperspace coordinates are easily available...hell, they aren't even valid theories yet. While spacecraft have advanced since the 20th Century, going from Earth to Mars still takes several weeks, and further out can take upwards of months to a year. All that time aboard a ship can lead to many poor decisions as crewmates start to lose patience with each other."
