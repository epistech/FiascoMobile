        "The Jersey Side is about a city on the other side of the river. Jersey City likes to call itself Wall Street West, but there is an air of desperate envy in the town that faces Manhattan across the Hudson. It will never match up. The Jersey Side is about a town too big for its britches, a place where rabbis run organ-legging rings, politicians are massively corrupt, and brokers who can't make it on Wall Street run dodgy deals.",
        "Fully urban and bounded by the New Jersey Turnpike on one side and the Hudson River on the other, Jersey City is a cramped microcosm of big city business and big city blight."
