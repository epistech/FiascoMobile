        "Our party's been in power for eleven years, and, oh, what glorious years they have been! Before our election, the United Kingdom was wracked with strikes, cradling it's failing economy. Now, thanks to mass unemployment and the sale of our public services to faceless international profiteers, we have brought Britain into a new era of prosperity, though the poorest seem rather worse off these days. Still, if they were clever enough to notice, they wouldn't be half so poor! And don't forget that it's hardly worth the bother pandering to the degenerates when their social class is so fond of the tabloid press, and the tabloid press is so fond of us.",
        "Of course, we remember from our Classics lessons that even the most glorious Rome must fall. Granted, the past decade has been a long one, and there are those within the cabinet cheating on their wives with each others' wives, sending sums of questionable money to strange dictators from Um Bongo Land, inhaling cocaine from the bare stomachs of sadomasochistic policement, and other such laddish activity. Some of our more imperial policies have earned us ire from terrorist forces in disputed territories, in addition to the usual ire surging forth from territories we don't want. And there is even suggestion of a political coup against our towering, fragrant source of inspiration; our great Prime Minister. But clearly this is all part of the natural rough-and-tumble of being in government, and the British people will thank us for our decade of hard work with another five years. Why, I do most honestly believe that the legacy we have left for this country will last forever."
