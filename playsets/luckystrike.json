        "This playset takes place at the United States Army's Camp Lucky Strike Replacement Depot, near Le Havre, France.",
        "By the fall of 1944, the U.S. Army was losing infantrymen faster than it could train new recruits. Poor planning and German tenacity combined to crate a deep manpower shortage on the front lines of the European theater. The ill-advised solution was the Replacement Depot, or \"repple-depple\". Nestled safely in the rear, the Replacement Depot was a temporary home for soldiers awaiting new units. Some were recovered from injuries, some were green troops directly for training known as \"replacement increments\", and some were \"otherwise displaced\" for various reasons, often dubious. They were sent to whatever unit had a need, often without regard for their specialty &mdash; anti-aircraft gunners and tank destroyers were thrown into infantry battalions and men who had never seen a tank were dropped into Shermans and told to learn fast. Men separated from comrades they had spent years training with were guaranteed never to see them again once they hit the repple-depple. Boredom and low morale led to crime and foolishness.",
        "It was, in a word, a fiasco."
