        "In the not so distant future, human kind has finally attained interstellar travel. Thanks to the invention of stasis, humans can travel great distances while consuming very few resources. Mega corporations are racing across the galaxy to find new sources of wealth and bring them back to earth, but wealth is not the only thing to be found in the could reaches of space. Not everyone is equipped to handle that.",
        "This playset is designed to parody films like Aliens. Rather than focusing on horror and/or action Colonials adopts the Coen-esque tragicomedy structure that you'd expect from a game of Fiasco.",
        "Colonials takes place in a universe with greedy megacorps, retro futuristic sci-fi, and of course unstoppable alien killing machines. Rather than playing scientists, explorers, and badasses who discover a colony after it has been destroyed you will be playing the sorry bastards who cause everything to go pear-shaped to begin with. Through your misplaced ambition and terrible impulse control you will (probably) cause your space colony to be overrun with terrifying space monsters.",
        "In Colonials, No matter what, during the tilt the monsters hatch/get loose/run amok in addition to the complications that you get from the tilt table in the usual way.",
