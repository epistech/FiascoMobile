        "Somewhere in the American countryside, far away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities and nestled amongst the woods, sits a small idyllic town. People who pass through the town are often enchanted by its charm, despite it's being isolated from ‘civilisation' by at least half a day's drive. And the people are charming too.",
        "But under the surface there are secrets. Secrets they have from each other, sometimes, but almost certainly secrets they keep from visitors. And it is said that many secrets lurk in the woods beyond the edge of town, where the shadows of trees obscure greater mysteries.",
        "The town has kept itself for a long time, has ensured secret remain secret. But when outisders come to town and begin digging around, what will the locals do to ensure their secrets remain hidden?",
        "Based in part on Twin Peaks, partly on modern day fairy tales where girls who venture into the woods find there are worse things than wolves lurking in the shadows, and partly on Lovecraftian horror about out of the way communities that have made pacts with dark and alien forces.",
        "This playset also taps into TV shows like Northern Exposure, and Gravity Falls if you'd prefer a slightly less grim story."
