        "It is the school that all the other schools whisper about. The campus grounds are the size of a park. The school buildings look like some grand, Hollywood mansion that is only ever seen in the movies. The teachers and administrators are all either certified geniuses, former company executives, or celebrities in their own right.",
        "And then there's the students. The heir to the Dengeki Electronics Zaibatsu? He goes there. The daughter of the Miyamoto Department Store president? She goes there too. That creepy kid who was on the television the other day helping police solve crimes with his \"psychic\" predictions? Yep, he's there as well.",
        "In a school where vast sums of money are commonplace, and the least privileged child is merely the son or daughter of an international investment banker, all concepts of normality are thrown out the window. Who is going to tell a child that can purchase small countries that they can't skip out on the weekly test? Who is going to teach the stuck-up handsome boy that just because he can fuck any girl he wants, doesn't mean he should?",
        "For the sake of this playset, we are assuming that you have a copy of the newly released Fiasco Companion. You'll want to use the softer Tilt and Aftermath tables...unless you really want the story of your rich kids to end traumatically, in which case, go for it! But it'll probably be more fun if it isn't taken as seriously as regular games of Fiasco."
