        "Sightings of a hairy, man-like creature in and around Sucker Creek go back hundreds of years—the legends of the Rayado people tell of Ni-teshi-ih; “The Strong One” who lived in the dark swamps of the Sucker Creek basin.",
		"Since white settlement of the region, reports of blood-chilling cries in the night and occasional sightings of the Beast have been a fixture of local gossip. Is it a madman? A crazed bear? Something strange and wholly new to science? No one knows, but those who have crossed paths with it are convinced of one thing—the Beast of Sucker Creek is real, and you don’t want to make it angry.",
		"Special Rule",
		"The Beast of Sucker Creek may be real or not, but by the end of the game no conclusive proof of its existence can remain. If it is real and photos are taken they must be lost or erased (if it is fake they are obvious hoaxes). If the carcass is paraded down Main Street it must later be devoured by wild dogs. If somebody has its baby...",
		"OK, that’s fine, actually.",
		"Trainwreck Mode",
		"This playset shares certain elements with Flyover and News Channel Six and they would be wonderful multi-Fiasco companions. Flyover-Beast- News Channel Six sounds very tasty, give it a try!"
