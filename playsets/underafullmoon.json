        "Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, in a small town at the edge of a deep dark forest, the people were a superstitious lot, afraid of the shadows, jumping at the howlings of wolves in the night. Some of them say that wolves walk amongst them as men, whilst others suggest there are darker magics at work in the town.",
        "And so it is that, when the town begins to be plagued by sinister occurrances, animals turning up dead and mutilated, the town elders look to each other to find a solution to their problems, whilst the rest of the town prepare themselves the best they can, locking their doors and windows at night, watching out for the suspicious activities of neighbours and strangers alike. And if someone dies tonight perhaps they'll take it into their own hands and ensure that one of those monsters dies tomorrow, hanging on the gallows at the centre of town.",
        "This Fiasco is based around the numerous games in which the townsfolk need to eliminate the werewolves amongst them, before they outnumber the townsfolk. It makes nods towards werewolf fiction and fairy tales, as well as films such as The Village and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.",
        "If there isn't clearly a werewolf in play when the characters are created you can discover one through play. Alternatively, whoever has the most black dice by the Aftermath (number of dice, not total rolled, and yes, this could be multiple players) are 'revealed' as the werewolves."
