        "Long ago and far away there was a great city, towers reaching into the heavens, reflected in the cold waters of the lake along which it sat. No-one knows for sure what happened to it, but people who know speak of a rivalry between a king and a queen that destroyed the royal dynasty and the city falling into the clutches of a mysterious but terrible masked figure.",
        "Here and now the city is but a memory. But what happens when those memories start to take form, when the ancient rivalries, the enigmatic figures and the unspeakable horrors hinted at begin to manifest? When the lines between reality and dream begin to blur will you find yourself lost amongst the empty haunted streets of the ancient city? Or will your fate be much much worse?",
        "A playset based loosely on The King In Yellow.",
        "Optional rule: ‘Ghost’ Dice",
        "Replacing two black and two white dice with four ‘Ghost’ Dice you can add a little extra uncertainty. A Ghost Die is presented when an action, that would otherwise lead to a good or bad outcome, is interrupted by some mysterious event. It will be subtle, not overtly supernatural, but enough to distract the active player and prevent the action being attempted, such as a picture falling off a wall, the sounds of footsteps in the empty room next door, the appearance of dripping blood from the ceiling. In game terms something the character has done has attracted the attention of the ‘ghosts’ in the story.",
		"During the Aftermath ignore the Ghost Dice til you’ve rolled your black and white dice. Then, once you have your result roll the Ghost Dice, subtracting the roll from the previous result. This gives you a new Aftermath score, which will be tinged with some genuinely terrifying ghostly activity. It’s possible that the character will be traumatised by these events - a result of zero likely means they’ll be haunted for the rest of their short lives. If the Ghost Dice is higher than the previous result, bringing the new total to a negative ammount, the character disappears from this reality altogether, possibly messily if you had a high black result, or just trapped forever if you had a high white result. Either way you get to narrate the final disappearance of your character. If you play out each die as a scene in your Aftermath make sure the last die is a Ghost Die, although feel free to use any additional Ghost Dice ahead of other dice you have."
