        "The heroes aboard Star Station Sigma took one look at that dimensional anomaly and they got the hell out of town.",
        "After the \"white hole\" (that’s what the super-genius science team called it) tore part of the station’s hull clean off, the stupid bastards in charge ordered an evacuation. A few minutes after that, they were headed back to Space Legion territory with FTL drives at maximum. But the white hole had busted the lower deck all to hell, damaging many of the escape pods, so a bunch of people got stranded aboard Star Station Sigma. The losers, mostly.",
        "Those left behind: some junior officers with delusions of competence, some hard-drinking pilots who didn’t respond to the alarm quickly enough, maintenance staff (glorified janitors), a few asshole security officers, and a bunch of prisoners from the holding area. Now every- one’s trying to figure out how the hell we’re going to get off this ship. Problem is, the Åx’Tularians hate the Kruk’Chels, the prisoners hate security, and the crew members hate the officers. The station’s orbiting a white hole, and everyone’s trying to kill everybody else, and we’re just a clump of space-waste circling the drain. I should’ve stuck with smuggling."

        "This playset takes place aboard a space station that’s slowly being torn apart by waves of quantum force from a dimensional anomaly. The characters are incompetent engineers, addicted medical officers, smugglers, pirates, prisoners, merchants, janitors, and religious fanat- ics—and they all want off this thing before it blows. Hilarity will doubtless ensue. Adding stunt dice to the mix can ramp up the chaos even more.",
        "COUNTDOWN TO OBVLIVION",
        "Put four stunt dice into the mix, two positive outcome and two negative outcome (the rules for using stunt dice are on page 81 of The Fiasco Companion).",
        "Any time a stunt die is chosen, a chunk of Star Station Sigma is ripped off and sucked into the white hole. An occupied chunk? An important chunk? Entirely up to you. Look at the locations list for suggestions of places that are now destroyed.",
        "When the last stunt die is chosen, the last piece of the actual station vanishes into the featureless anomaly forever. Since this event is heavily telegraphed, hopefully some alternative has been engineered in the interim. If not, perhaps your Fiasco ends early-or perhaps it continues on the other side of the white hole!"
