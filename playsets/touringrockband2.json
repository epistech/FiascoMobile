Back when you were the big deal, touring the world behind an album that could have—should have—gone platinum. You had your moment and now it has passed. The band broke up, over sex and money and a lot of stuff that seems trivial now.",
        "You’ve had to tone it down a little, accept a new sort of reality that involved trashing fewer hotel rooms and paying more bills on time and getting prostate exams that are actually prostate exams.",
        "But the dreams never died, and lately the various anemic side projects have been less and less satisfying. And as bad decisions and old bridges burned come back to haunt you, the idea of revisiting past glory seems better and better. God knows you need the cash. And you still have fans on the Internet who would kill to see the band get back together..."
