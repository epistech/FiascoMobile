        "Hong Kong, June 1997: Over 150 years of British rule is drawing to a close, and everybody is scrambling to make their mark before the handover. The Crown Colony is a pressure-cooker of energy and uncertainty, and nobody is sure who is going to come out on top—it's the world's most exclusive night club, an hour before closing. With guns. Lots of guns.",
        "From the triad gangsters to the cops to the big-business taipans, the players are in motion and everybody has got something in the pot. Old man Liang is packing up and heading to Canada. Helen Chu's brother works for the government, and he says the PRC is going to lock everything down. Jimmy Wong says he's going nowhere because where there's uncertainty, there's money to be made.",
