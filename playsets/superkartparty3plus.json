        "Some people are na&iuml;ve enough to think that working as a video game tester is a fun, easy job. It can be a good way to get your foot in the door, but the hours can be brutal, the games often suck even when they aren't ridiculously buggy, the programmers hate you, and your coworkers probably have some kind of hazing in mind.",
		"Nakatomi Games is a venerable Japanese video game company, and you work in the testing department at its American office in Silicon Valley. And there's this game. You've had to test some real stinkers before, but this one is by far one of the worst. It's called Super Kart Party 3 Plus! Everything about it is terrible, and if anyone had any sense they'd just cancel it. That would be the merciful thing to do. But the company has already shelled out for a number of very high-profile licensed characters—ones that don't make any damn sense to you—so upper management is very attached to the project. It's also going to have motion controls, DLC, and all the other bullshit buzzword crap no one actually wants.",
		"With the release date for SKP3+ looming ever closer, crunch time is upon you. The testers are working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week minimum to try to get this stupid game whipped into shape, and the programmers look like they haven't seen the sun in a while. Chances are it's just not going to make it, but don't let management hear you talking that way. (Not that they want to hear what you have to say at the best of times.) Just fucking get to work."
