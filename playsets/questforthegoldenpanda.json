In these mystical times anything could happen and everything could be a sign from the ancestors. One such myth was the tale of the Golden Panda. You loved it as a child - but now you have come to find that is true. Will you seek the Golden Panda? Are you up to the task?",
        "You live in interesting times. One must be ever wary of Shaolin monks or errant swordsman dashing through bamboo screens to attack you. This secret is too important to be left by the wayside - a course of action that would bring you shame and the disdain of your ancestors. Never give up and stay true to who you are. Let the spirits guide you in your quest for the Golden Panda."
