On this luxury cruiser's maiden voyage, the Captain has been directed to quietly contend for the glorious Blue Riband -- the accolade awarded to the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Topside, you enjoy a salty Gibson while pulling the heavy double wool of your coat closer to your body. Friends make merry with lively talk amongst themselves -- it's a din barely overheard above the hammering engine and thresh of the ship's mighty propellers. Spray from the bow's cleave manages to catch your cheek even this far aft. You smile, playing the cocktail's onion lightly on your tongue. Your gaze draws across the dull, slate waters wondering at the marvel of it all: New beginnings? Maybe this time things will be different? Perhaps your dreams are within reach? What could possibly go wrong?"
