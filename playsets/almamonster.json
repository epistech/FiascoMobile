In a well-regarded \"public ivy\" university, secluded away where most students are not allowed cars and there are no commuters, students and faculty have the same problems as anyone at college. Only, there might be a strange house or rumors of a mysterious society. No way any of that will interfere with finals.",
        "This playset assumes most players will be students, with maybe a professor or two. Additionally, there are some weirder elements (many inspired by Lovecraft), but nothing outright supernatural unless you want there to be. The strange things tend to be clustered around the “6s” so in case your group wants nothing to do with the weird, you should be able to steer away from it pretty easily."
