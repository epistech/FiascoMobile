Bowing to no temporal authority and disregarding such mortal concerns as effectiveness, authenticity, racism, or taste, they clash with one another in underground fight clubs, heavily padded tournament halls, or black-backgrounded forums on the Internet.",

Maybe you needed a front for your drug dealership, or maybe you were just lonely. In any case, there's no backing out now. The gloves are off, or in some cases on, depending on your style. Ahead of you, the road to hell is paved with broken bottles, splintered timber, and the curbstomped faces of your enemies. Right after that it's paved with warrants for your arrest. Now come out and play."
