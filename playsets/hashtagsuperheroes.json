        "No-one can escape social media's pervasive influence, especially the superheroes who so valiantly fight to protect our cities. In many ways, they are the ultimate celebrities of today. And with all that saving of the planet to do, many have decided to hire professional help to keep up with their twitter account and schedule talk show appearances.",
        "You are these professionals. As members of a prestigious PR agency's Client Service Team it is your job to make sure the hero doesn't cause a shitstorm on the message boards and wears this fall's colours to the next red carpet event.",
        "Without your help the hero's next interview could very well turn into a social media fiasco...",
        "Regarding Superheroes",
        "This playset is about the men and women busting ass to make sure the squeaky-clean public image of the city's beloved superhero stays untarnished. Whereas our protagonists' superpowers are limited to witty pop culture references and photoshopping wizardry, the real heroes with their superpowers are bound to show up eventually. When a scene calls for a superhero or a villain, coming up with a flashy superpower and a cool name should suffice for starters, as you can always define (or retcon) the character further in future scenes. And don't hesitate to look at existing superheroes for inspiration. After all, there are plenty of good examples out there to steal draw from."
