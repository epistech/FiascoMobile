        "Devil's Night takes place in Detroit, Michigan around the night of October 30th when delinquents go on a spree of arson and vandalism. This year the acts of criminal mischief will reach an all-time high, as roaming beer and drug fuelled mobs set hundreds of homes and businesses ablaze. Most of the city's police are on strike and residents will barricade themselves in their homes. And this is when the undead choose to attack.",
		"A large force of savage vampires has crept into town over the past week and “created” many new recruits from the ranks of Detroit's citizens. Their objective: To hunt down and eliminate their rival, more genteel vampires existing in the city, using the chaos and confusion of Devil's Night to conceal their activities from the mortals...but not very carefully.",	
		"Players will assume the roles of miscreant youths out for a good time, vigilant business and home owners desperate to protect their property, newly turned undead soldiers in the vampire war, resident vampires under attack, or one of the few public servants who take it upon themselves to protect their city.",
		"Some of the relationships should be used with caution. Most of the relationships should work fine as is, but a few occupations might seem confusing when assigned to the same character. If it seems too weird for the undercover cop to also be a TV reporter, pick something else. Regarding the vampires, most of the undead who have been so for a while would want to blend in with society, so they might have a “night job” as a police detective. Whether their co-workers suspect or already know the truth about them is something to find out in play."
