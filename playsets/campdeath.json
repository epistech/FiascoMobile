		"What I know is that we've got a couple weeks to get this place set up before any campers arrive, and most of the hard work is already done. We've got enough booze, pot, and distance from authority to make this the greatest summer ever.",
		"What could go wrong?",
		"READ THIS! Seriously. Read it.",
		"Slasher films are notorious for late-movie revelations and plot twists, and Camp Death is no exception. The Who Is The Killer? section at the end of this Playset includes a few options for determining the identity of the killer. Before starting the game, take a look at the options and decide which you want to use.",
		"One final note: take care when choosing Relationships in this Playset. Many of the elements, such as those under \"Local,\" assume that only one character will be a camp counselor, and this may result in difficult or impossible combinations."
