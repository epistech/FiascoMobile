        "The Knights of Light are a small, local guild for an extremely popular MMORPG that shall remain unnamed. You’re all pretty damn serious about this whole thing. You play very regularly, and if you make plans for a raid you are absurdly dedicated to keeping them. Your fellow guild members don’t always get along, but for the most part everyone knows what they’re doing in the game. (Too bad you can’t say the same about life in general.) Chances are you haven’t actually met in person, but that’s probably going to change, because Fiasco games are crazy like that.",
		"Slight Variations:",
		"* Scene Types: Any time you start a scene, be sure to declare whether it’s in real life or online. \"Online\" doesn’t have to be in the game necessarily; you could, for example, have an entire scene consisting of players taking turns narrating guild forum posts or IM chat sessions.",
		"* Events: For the purposes of this playset I've replaced \"Locations\" with \"Events.\" Apart from having a somewhat different flavor, these should slot in the same place just fine.",
		"* Tilt Events: If you’re feeling particularly adventurous you could let players choose entries from the Events table for the Tilt."
