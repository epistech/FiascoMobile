        "The bumpkins in this pissant mountain town could never have taken down that dragon. Their biggest hero hasn't seen battle since Drozzek rode down from the Smoking Mountains three wars-to-end-all-wars ago. That old fuck they call their town wizard fried his brain with one too many \"elixirs of awareness\" and can't even light a campfire with all his spells combined.",
        "So yeah, we rode into town, a bunch of outsiders ready to solve that problem. Solve a motherfucking dragon. And no, we don't care what they think. And yes, we're fucking heroes. These yokels should worship at our feet. They didn't blast those mummies to dust or make a deathtrap built with technology lost centuries ago their bitch. And they sure as hell didn't slay that dragon.",
        "That's our dragon, and its gold is our gold. So unless you're bringing us ale and whores, get the fuck out before we transform you into a turkey and serve you for dinner."
