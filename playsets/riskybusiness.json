However, who’s to say that it might not be more dangerous within the bunker?",

Unless you have a lot of players it’s advised that each character represents a different country.",

There’s no specific threat beyond those created during the set-up, but you may introduce others as the game goes on. Scenes can be set either in the main meeting room of the bunker, quiter rooms elsewhere within the complex, or outside the bunker, as a flashback."
