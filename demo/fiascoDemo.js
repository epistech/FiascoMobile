Last year, the city endured the chaos of the blackout of ‘77 and the terror of the Son of Sam killings. This year, Studio 54 makes millions by giving beautiful plebs and dazzling celebrities a place to party at $20 a head. Condensed sweat rains from Studio 54’s mirrored-laminate ceiling—sweat evaporated from the brows of celebrities, maybe—and falls back on the dancers below.", "This is the year of Saturday Night Fever's public zeal and Saturday Night Live's last season with Aykroyd and Belushi—a year bookended by The Village Peoples' \"Macho Man\" and \"Y.M.C.A.\" In New York, The Rolling Stones play at the Palladium in July (and Mick Jagger is likely seen at Studio 54) while Queen plays two nights on tour for their new album, Jazz, in November, at Madison Square Garden. Rod Stewart's \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?,\" a song of dance-club lust, appears at the end of this year.", "This is a New York City that has recently discovered Star Wars, Annie Hall, Smokey and the Bandit, and Close Encounters. Superman, The Deer Hunter, and Every Which Way But Loose come out in December. The Warriors comes out next year but its inspiration is all around. Refer to real-world gangs like the Young Immortals, the Majestics, and the Dukes for some thematic verisimilitude. Organized crime of any stripe is apt in this age—and RICO was enacted just eight years ago.", "This is a time of rock and disco, of reckless hedonism and casual sex, a time before consequences. Debauchees high on blow, poppers, or Quaaludes dance and laugh and lust and cry in swank clubs and dirty dives all over the city. Whoever your characters are in the daylight, come dark they transform into sordid stars or disco royalty, beautiful disasters or pitiable victors, ricocheting off each other into the glittering wreckage of imploded parties. Every Saturday night the city's alight with spectacular fiascos." ], "tagline" : "On Saturday Night" }, "relationships" : [ { "title" : "Partnerships", "elements" : [ "Dance partners, one of them truly talented", "Maverick veteran cop and straight-laced rookie", "Sweethearts still", "Uniformed cops with overlapping beats", "Co-owners of the fourth-hottest nightclub in the five boroughs", "Husband and wife, if anyone asks" ] }, { "title" : "Rivalries", "elements" : [ "Hothead and the supervisor on the hook for it", "Contenders for the same heart", "Dancers on the same slick floor", "Cops competing for the same collar", "Siblings ever at war", "Drug dealers in the same club circuit" ] }, { "title" : "Crime", "elements" : [ "Supplier and seller", "Newly minted gangsters", "Blackmailer and victim", "Official on the take and someone paying the rake", "The muscle and the mouth", "Criminal accessories, both" ] }, { "title" : "Romance", "elements" : [ "One's beloved, one's oblivious", "A one-night stand that the gonorrhea won't let you forget about", "Husband and wife, for now", "Just another Romeo and Juliet", "Someday soon.
