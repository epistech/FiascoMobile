        "\"Somewhere under a lost and lonely hill of grim and foreboding aspect lies a labyrinthine crypt. It is filled with terrible traps and not a few strange and ferocious monsters to slay the unwary. It is filled with rich treasures both precious and magical...\"",
		"Gary Gygax, The Tomb of Horrors, p.2.",
		"The Tomb of Horrors is a small dungeon, diabolically populated with traps, misdirection and monsters. Only the strongest and best equipped adventuring parties have even the slimmest chance of surviving the protections with guard the crypt of the Lich who awaits within. Of course, by the time any D&D party has reached this sort of level, even an initially unified group of characters will have been riven and sundered by the trials of a career of murder and looting. This playset is about those rifts in the party. Oh yes, it's a Fiasco alright!",
		"Things to Look For",
		"The First Act should start with the characters already deep inside the tomb. As in a regular game of Fiasco, it's probably impolite to kill other players in the First Act – you'll be doing better than in the original module, already! – but feel free to trap people in impossible situations, strip them of equipment, maim them, all the usual fun stuff. There should be a trap (or less frequently, a monster) in every scene, not necessarily as an obstacle, but at least for colour. Use the Location and Object lists as inspiration. Be diabolical.",
		"If the group is actually trying to kill the Lich and take his treasure, you might want to save that conflict for the last set of scenes, or even the Aftermath. That said, meeting and defeating the Tomb's main denizen could make for a great start to the game as well."
